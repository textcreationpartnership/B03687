         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Earest Lord; I am thine, and thou art mine; make me more thine, be thou more mine. Oh what have <hi>I</hi> in thee! <hi>I</hi> have more in thee than <hi>I</hi> can fathom; for thou art infinite in all perfections; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wisdom, perfect righteousness, perfect holiness, perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, perfect strength, perfect power, perfect riches, perfect all things; eternally perfect, everlasting satisfactions; who can set forth all thy praises? thou art an incomprehensible portion; he that hath thee, can want no good thing, because thou art all good things to him, his light, his life, his righteousness; his strength and his salvation: All things are thine in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and all thine are theirs who are thine; for their welfare and happiness; they're in thy hand, and at thy dispose, who art a God of love, of wisdom, of infinite judgement and understanding. Oh happy portion! But what hast thou in me Lord, a poor creature, an empty nothing, weakness, infirmity and sin. Yet such as <hi>I</hi> am, <hi>I</hi> am thine, and it's my happiness that <hi>I</hi> am thine, or rather and much more, that thou art mine. I am thine, save me; thou art mine, satisfie me; and that I may be satisfied in and by thee, sanctifie me to thee: Help me to leave my self to, and with thee; go out of my self and all creatures, to and after thee, and follow thee whithersoever thou leadest me. Thou thy self wastled for me to the shearers, and to the shambles, and by those things to eternal glory; if it be thy will to lead me that way thither, give me thy strength and power to follow thee, and it will be well with me. Thine is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Glory; thou canst with-hold such tryals from me, and thou canst car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me through such tryals, to the enjoyment of thy glory. Help me to devote my self to thee, yeild up my self to be disposed by thee, not chusing my own lot or portion, but let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thee chuse and carve in all things for me. I have no such acquaintance with any of the great ones of this world, that <hi>I</hi> should write my self theirs, and dedicate my labours to them. <hi>I</hi> bless thee that I am a stranger to them. <hi>I</hi> have enongh to content my soul in thee; they cannot add to thee, nor desire I any thing from them to be added to me. My way lyes very fair and clear besides them to thee. And they lesse hinder me therein, than if I was engaged to them, and courted by them. Thou wert a stranger to them in this world; <hi>I</hi> find not thee in <hi>Herod</hi>'s Hall, or <hi>Bilate</hi>'s, or the High-priests Pallaces, but when they condemned and abused thee. Alas! these yet too commonly are they that being at ease in themselves, contemn and hate thee, and priding themselves in their worldly enjoyments, feel no need of thee, yea persecute thee in thy poor members, whom while they decree unrighteous Decrees against, and vilifie and slay, they think they serve thee very acceptably. But oh that they knew thee, felt thy sweetness, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:179873:4"/> thy presence! then would they worship thee in spirit and truth, and not in outward empty formality onely. Lord open their eyes that they may see and know thee, thy truth and people, and not adore others instead of thee, hating the good, and loving the evil as they do too generally. The poor of this world hast thou chosen rich in faith, heirs of thy glory. Thy Spouse is not that painted Strumpet that rides in pomp, and is ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and defiled by the Kings of the Earth. She is another kind of thing that the world doth not see, because it sees not thee, nor knows thee. But thine do know thee, and are known of thee. Companion am I (Oh yet, make me more so!) to those that fear thee, and those that know and keep thy Testimonies: They were thy Companions while thou wert on the Earth, thy Mother, Brethren, Sisters, though mean in the eyes of men,<note place="margin">Mal. 3 1.</note> and despised by the great Princes and Rabbies of those dayes, yea though they pretended a desire after thee, and love to thee; but when thou wast amongst them, they did not know thee, nor love either thee, or those that loved thee. Let not me think any of them too mean to be my companions, that thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainest not to be thine. They are the truly noble persons that are so near a kin by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and divine birth to thee; they are from above, as thou wert from above; they are the heirs of thy Kingdom, and shall inherit it with thee everlastingly. Oh thou infinite fulness, infinite sweetness, eternal excellency, flow thou in upon me by thy Light, Truth and holy Spirit; let them lead me to thee; let them fill me with thee: Accept <hi>I</hi> beseech thee my Dedication of my self and service to thee, and let it not be reputed a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me. Thou givest me access to thee, leave to be humbly bold with thee; thou art meek and lowly, though thou beest most high and mighty; thou lovest and ownest, and disdainest not thy poorest creatures that crawl towards thee. None for Greatness, none for Goodness to be compared to thee; Thy arms are open to embrace, thy heart is open to love and delight in thy poor servants that are faithful to thee, and upright with thee. Lord make me so evermore towards thee, keep me in thy arms, lay me in thy bosom, let me be always nigh thee, with thee; and be thou always nigh, with and in me, manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy self, thy love, thy fulness, thy glory to me, and strengthen me to glory in thee, and serve and glorifie thee perpetually. <hi>I</hi> am ashamed of my self, and my poor doings, they smell too much of flesh and self, too little of thee; and therefore there is the less in them to be liked by me. Accept and prosper thine own in them; pardon or burn up what in my writings is not thine, nor approved by thee: And oh discover thy Truth more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me, and if thou pleasest by me, who desires to devote my self and service to thee. Everlasting King of Glory, everlasting praises to thee, my Portion everlastingly. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. IN his 7th. Exception toucing the Law, I convicted him of divers notorious falshoods; see now how instead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing his faults therein, he casts about for mysts and muffles to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve himself in. 1. To that that I denied the Law to be a rule of Life, he saies, <q>I am not the first that hath spoken contradictions, nor the last that confutes an Adversary out of his own words.</q>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> So then my words had some contradiction in them, or else this is a myst, mufflle, or frivolous evasion. If <hi>I</hi> contradicted my self, I did both affirm it and deny it in the same respect; for that's to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict. Now <hi>I</hi> challenge him to prove that <hi>I</hi> denied it. He says, "<hi>I assigned five uses of it, and to be a Rule of Life was none of them. Ans.</hi> 1. Be it that <hi>I</hi> had omitted it; yet to omit a thing, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, are not the same; not to say a thing, and to say that thing is not, are very different. 2. How did <hi>I</hi> omit that, and yet affirm it? for if <hi>I</hi> affirmed it not, then I could not contradict my self if I

He says, "<hi>I said it not directly, and every one could not gather it from my words.

I shewed him how he falsified in charging me from my open door to have faulted Ministers for teaching duties to them that wanted Principles to perform them rightly, and so, that the Law must not be a Rule to persons unconverted neither, and so to none. Now instead of confessing his wrong, he onely repeats and commits it over again, yea a second and third time, p. 76. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either answer or further proof, viz. <q>That I faulted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters for being Teachers of the Law to them that are not well principled for duties <hi>See his falshood again!</hi>
                  </q> I said not so, nor to that purpose; but I faulted those that talkt of duties to those not principled, without declaring to them that which should rightly principle them. Now is it the same thing to fault a man simply for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty, and to fault him for not doing it as he ought? is the rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terating a slander, a vindicating a mans self not to have slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

For his nests of falshoods about my holding the Moral Law now to us a cruel School-Master; he hath these muffiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of confessing his evil in them. 1. <q>That its an ordinary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of others that recede from the Antinomians more than I, and so he had no reason to leave me out.</q>
                  <hi>Ans</hi> Judge Reader, had he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to say more of me, than he could justifie! Was that a good reason to speak falsly of me? And is this a good come off to add more abuses to his former, by implying that I border too nearly upon the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> without any proof of it? Indeed he tells me of <hi>my Antinomian spots breaking out,</hi> p. 156. because to the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> urging <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.1. to prove that some are personally perfect without sin here. I said, Christ is the Way, and I grant some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled and compleat in him. Now where is the <hi>Antinomianism</hi> in that saying? Is it in saying Christ is the way? <hi>Then Christ was one,</hi> they be his words, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. or in saying there be some compleat in Christ? then <hi>Paul</hi> was one, for he says so in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. Or in my interpreting the sayings of the Old-Testament, or rather of the Prophets, by Christ's and his Apostles? Who are better interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of them? Or who doth not use to interpret their sayings by them? Is not <hi>perfect in Christ Jesus,</hi> Col. 1.28. a good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>perfect in the way,</hi> Psal. 119.1.? Or can there be a better? Is there any perfect in the Law of Works? judge Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179873:7"/> 2. <hi>That I hold not long in that mind, he finds me another,</hi> p. 83. because I said <hi>the Apostles did not bring men into servitude as</hi> Moses <hi>did formerly, but to son-ship.</hi> Now what says that to the falshoods above-disclaimed? not one word; but he says, <hi>I make an opposition between servitude and son-ship, whereas it should be between manhood and minority of age, if I had continued in that mind. Ans.</hi> I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that mind, and yet justifie my oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;<note place="margin">Cum essemus parvuli sub Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> for the Apostle makes it so, though he spake of the Law being their School-Master in the former ages, and rather of the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, than the Moral; see <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 5, 6 7. For what though the believers in the times before, were sons, yet they differed nothing from ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Christ (I trow) redeemed them from servitude, and from their Tutors and Governors, that they might receive the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sons: So that instead of recanting his abuses, he makes them worse. <hi>Moses</hi> Law made sons as servants, the Apostles makes servants to be sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5 Again in Chap. 10. he suspected a dark insinuation of a dangerous conception of God's having done for us all that he could. I shewed the groundlesness of that suspition: Now how comes he off here? Sure with horrible muffles and mistakes of what I said in that Chapter. For he saies I say therein, <q>That it wil pose all men to say what he could have done more; as if I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not what I say, so I revile and contradict; that I speak as if God could do no more than he hath done for man's salvation; that I give an imperfect enumeration of the means and helps that God hath afforded to salvation; that he hath given his Son to death, raised him, and glorified him; and there stay, and tell them that there is no more that could be done; that I omit the internal means, and mention only the external and most remote means, Christ's death and rising again.</q> Now Reader see whence and how false all this is. What I said, was this, That all my instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions to seek the Lord, imply, that I think God can do no more than he hath done, though what he could have done more for our Redemption, and for providing salvation for us, then to have given his onely Son to death for us, and raise and glorifie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179873:7"/> him as he hath done, I suppose must pose all men to say. See Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I said not, God can do no more than he hath done for man's salvation, or that the death, resurrection and glorifying of Christ, are all the means of salvation that God affords; but I spake onely of man's Redemption, and the providing salvation for him, not of his bringing men to enjoy that salvation; for which I acknowledged all along in my Catechism, other means, both outward and inward. Know then Reader, and know it for thine own good, that we say with the Scriptures, that God hath by the death of his Son ransomed and redeemed all men from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sentence that lay upon them, into the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lordship and dispose of Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9.</note> so as they may be saved by him, and hath prepared salvation for us all in him, in glorifying him through his sufferings for us, even all things pertaining to our salvation, as forgiveness of our sins, and his holy Spirit, by which he is fitted and ready to enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, regenerate, sanctifie and save us; but to the obtaining of that salvation, he requires that we look to him, and be saved; seek him while he may be found, and call upon him while nigh at hand; and whoso do so in truth, in this day of Grace, shall surely find him to work all the work of God in them. Therefore in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief thereof do thou seek him, and content not thy self with any gifts from him, without him, but seek to have himself all to thee, and to do all in thee, in thy attending to, and believing on him. True, there is a Redemption by his Grace and Spirit passing upon the spirits and bodies of them that believe, included in what thou art to seek for; but it's clear by the contexture of what I spake, that I meant not of that Redemption in my speech above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, but of what conduced to the preparation of salvation for us. See this distinction of the preparation and participation of salvation, clearly implied in <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.4. and the preparation perfect before the invitation, much more before the participation. What he sayes then, p. 104. and from 115. to 122. and are meer extravagancies, though I might note his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with God, p. 120, 121. in telling what could have been done in his Vinyard, more than he did; and his error in saying, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179873:8"/>
                  <q>all he did was but external means and helps exhibited to a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, National constituted Church, as Doctrine, Sacraments, Prophets, Pastors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> but no Spirit thought of that had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and virtue to effect any thing required, contrary to <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.20, 30. <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.10, 11. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.12. and putting this answer into their mouth, <hi>Lord, thou gavest us no internal means, without which all the external were to no purpose.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sest.</hi> 6. Again in Chap. 25. though he more fairly passes by many a discovered falshood and abuse that I noted in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not mentioning, much less confessing them; yet in what he takes notice of, he shamefully shuffles and evades, adding more absurd abuses to his former, representing it as my usual Doctrine that we should not gather God's love to us by Faith, obedience, new frames, &amp;c. a phrase or manner of speaking ambiguous and deceitful, and such as I never made use of, though it is true in it self with respect to the first perception of his love, which is the spring of faith, obedience, and new frames; but his speech carries it to his love indifinitely in any acts of it; and to my explication of my mind, in which he gives this unreasonable answer, That <hi>he will believe it to have some truth, or at least some reason in it, when he shall believe that there ever was any Christian that did search into his own heart, and seek there for good desires and affections, to the intent he might thence conclude and know assuredly, that Jesus Christ dyed for all men in the world.</hi> Or when I can shew him whoever taught any Christian so to do, as if I had to any such purpose explicated my self. Oh wilful myst and muffle! my saying was, That men may not so well know the remedy to be for themselves (not for all men in the world) by looking into their own hearts, as by the Word of God, which sayes it is for all. This he see and read, and knew to be my meaning, and yet grosly turns it into quite another non-sensical thing, which he again intimately charges on me, p. 216. and in spite of my declaration of my self, otherwise says, that <hi>this was the reigning Disease, the Doctrine against which I framed my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes, viz. that a Christian from the fruits of his sanctification in his thoughts, words and works, and especially from the frame and disposition of his heart, may gather the love of God, and the benefits of Christ's death for his glorification; and that J cannot endure any such difference as that there be a seal of Gods Spirit set upon those that are his in this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179873:8"/> life;</hi> and that I <hi>think him a Pharisee that is not as other men are, but gives thanks that he is better than others, better than this Malefactor, and Traytor, or Publican: This is that poyson that needs the Antidote. Ans.</hi> Reader, Judge if Forgery and Slander be any good answers; or what should I say to such a man, except as 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>From such unreasonable men good Lord deliver us?</hi> And for thy own use understand, that I say and hold, 1. That the first perception of the love of God to us, as that he sent his Son for us, and Christ dyed for us, is not by or from works of righteousness that we have done, or do, though many we may do appearingly before it, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle did, who yet sayes not that by them he perceived the love of God, or was saved, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. 2. That the perception of the love of God to us (as before) goes before any right work of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, or sanctification in us, and is the true spring of them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. &amp; 3.4, 5. But then (3dly) after the love of God in the gift of Christ is discovered and perceived, we are to take heed that we so receive it, as to be filled with righteous frames and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and works by it, otherwise we receive it in vain. And 4thly, we may, and are to examine our selves, whether we so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Grace and Love perceived; and that is properly to be known by what it effects in us. And so (5thly,) we may gather or assure our hearts of God's further love to us, that he owns and will bless us, partly from the perception of the efficacies of Gods love in us. But (6thly,) many are gull'd with conceits of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sanctified by false marks; and generally men are so, when they know not that love of God in Christ which is the ground of right lieving, but from some effects of faith which they guesse to be in them; seeking to perceive first the love of God to them by what is in them, and not by what is in Christ, as preached in the Gospel to them; and that if Mr. <hi>Hacon</hi> take this his so dealing with me for any such mark or evidence of his title to Heaven, he hath need to take heed he deceive not himself therein. And now thou maist see by this how impertinently he quotes 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. against a passage of mine in a Sermon that he quotes; the Apostle not speaking of mens examining themselves whither God had so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, as to send Christ for them (which was the thing J spake of, though he conceal it) but whether they were in the faith, and Christ in them, or not after they had believed the love of God in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:179873:9"/> Christ as preached in the Gospel to them; and so not to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God had loved them, but whether they loved God rather. And though the signs that men now seek for to know by that God sent Christ for them, and that he died for them, be not of the same kind with those the <hi>Jews</hi> fought; yet they not resting in God's Testimony, but seeking some other sign for the heart to rest in, is like Adultery from God's Word. My quoting ver. 11. of <hi>Luke</hi> 18. cannot prove that I meant men may not use upon no case the Pharisees words there, or that I meant not that I fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men for doing as he did, when I actually mentioned the words of ver. 9. his trusting in himself, and despising others; that I used the phrase <hi>Analogy of the Faith,</hi> in the vulgar sence, although I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that I conceive the Apostle uses it in another sence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3 was no great fault, if any; and that there is need to warn of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> as well as of <hi>pride,</hi> I believe. The Lord purge both of them out of both our hearts; for methinks too much of both appears in his Writings. And let that suffice to that branch of the Charge.</p>

J owe my consent (saies <hi>Austin</hi>) without exception, onely to the holy Canonical Scriptures. Again, Take away our Writings, let God's Book be produced A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I would not have the Church shewed by mens documents, but by God's Oracles: And St. <hi>Ambrose;</hi> J would not that we be rested in, let the Scriptures be recited. 2. Because J said, J contented my self with the Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase, and used not that of the Church. <hi>Ans.</hi> Js that a sufficient proof that J neglect its Authority given it of Christ? Doth the Church tye me to use her phrases rather than the Scriptures? J trow not. And may J not speak <hi>uno ore</hi> with the Church (as he implies J do not) by speaking in Scripture-phrases? Surely J may, or else the Church speaks not <hi>uno ore,</hi> or is not unanimous with the Apostles, because she uses that phrase, <hi>the Rule of Life,</hi> which they use not. So that in accusing me, he intimately condemns the Church, and shews his want of judgement.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The latter part of that is a slander; for J said expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God works it by the co-operation of the Holy Ghost, which is not only by the Word preached, as if it was without the Holy Ghost.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> J plainly shewed Chap. 16. that persons are named from the qualities, not that the qualities are the Names. <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> or a <hi>prudent man</hi> is the Name, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.21. and <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>haughty scorner</hi> is his Name, says <hi>Prov</hi> 21.24. that deals in proud wrath. <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> are the qualities, not the names. Might not J as well charge Mr. <hi>Hacon</hi> with simbolizing with the <hi>Papists,</hi> in preferring the Churches Authority before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and with the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> in denying the insufficiency of general Grace; but J forbear such retalliations.

But all this while he offers at nothing of my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, onely at length catches at a piece of a sentence, from which he talks at rovers, and shews that some (as the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who are nothing of my acquaintance) hold some irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles; and then adds, that <hi>unless we say that God doth not foreknow what man will do upon such and such circumstances, we cannot but of necessity confess that he hath for some certain men prepared such grace whereby they shall certainly and infallibly be saved; and that if Faith be the gift of God, and he gives it to whom he will give it, this is that Predestination with which I endeavour what I can to fright the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:179873:10"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> His consequence is very loose; for although God doth certainly foreknow what man will do upon such and such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, yet nevertheless he doth also foreknow, that the same Grace that he prepared for, and affords to some in whom it takes not place, will certainly and infallibly take place in others. And so <hi>è contra,</hi> as he did certainly fore-know that the same Grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for, and afforded to the <hi>Jews,</hi> though they rejected it, would certainly have taken place with a people of a strange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, had it been afforded to them, <hi>Ezek</hi> 3 6. and gave <hi>Paul</hi> to know, that what the <hi>Jews</hi> rejected, would be by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.28. yet I deny not, but God hath prepared that Grace for all men in Christ, by which some shall certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly be saved. 2. <hi>I</hi> endeavour not to fright the World with any Predestination, except of God's fore-appointing obstinate, impenitent sinners to damnation. I would they were more fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that from their sins. And therefore it's false, that the asserting faith to be God's gift, and his giving it to whom he will, is that Predestination that I endeavour to fright the World with, or any Predestination at all. His charge then, that what he called <hi>an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Principle, I must fall to, and defend by rational consequence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I will give over my horrible and irreligious manner of reviling Gods Decrees</hi> As it offers nothing to disprove my Answer or Marginal Note he excepted against, which should have been his task; so it is a falshood, and carries in the taile of it an horrible and odious slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I challeng'd him to shew me where in any place I have ever spoken irreverently of God's Decrees, much more that I have reviled any of them; which if he cannot do, let the Reader judge what spirit he is of, and what manner of adversary he is unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. In the close of my Chapter I said, I fear'd that he thinks God decreed and necessitated <hi>Adam's</hi> sin, and that I might find passages enough to that purpose in other mens sayings, would I follow his course, in fastening them upon him, to render his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions odious, which I said Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had done sufficiently. To this, he first endeavours to clear himself, though not handsomely; For his second proposition, viz. <hi>That in those things that are decreed to come to passe, God's Decree inferreth no nccessity upon inferior causes or agents, because he decrees all things to come to passe according to their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:179873:11"/> kind; natural agents to act naturally, voluntary agents, voluntarily; and so for necessary, contingent, &amp;c.</hi> For this passage I conceive is peccant both in its assertion &amp; reason. 1. The assertion:<note place="margin">Voluntas Dei in quibusdam necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem imponit: non tantum secundum id quod fit, sed eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am secundum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum fiendi vel es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendi, &amp;c. <hi>Th. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. l. Qu. 19. 8.</hi>
                  </note> For in many things decreed to come to pass, a necessity is surely thereby inferred upon inferior causes, whether natural or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary; as God hath decreed, That so long as the Earth remaineth, Seed-time and Harvest, cold and heat. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall not cease. Doth this infer no necessity upon the Sun shining, and rain falling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Could we have those things without these? See also <hi>Psal</hi> 148.6. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22. for his Decree for bounding the Seas and Waters; yea did not Gods Decree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den, infer a necessity that they should forbear to devour him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The reason for it is not alwayes true, that what comes to pass is according to the kind of inferior agents or causes: Was it according to their kind for the clay and spittle, and waters of <hi>Siloam</hi> to open the blind mans eyes? Or did the fire act according to its kind, when it singed not the Garments of the three Worthies,<note place="margin">Quibusdam ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibus aptavit causas necessarias qua deficere non possunt, ex quibus effectus ex necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate proveniunt. <hi>Aquin. ss. 161.</hi>

How should Gods Decrees in necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agents, put no necessity upon their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary actions, because they work according to their kind? Sure either Mr. <hi>Hacon</hi> should have said that in things decreed to be permitted to come to pass, Gods Decrees infer no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or else he knew not well what he wrote.</p>

And whereas he adds, That <hi>as faith is a principle of spiritual life, so it is withall a part of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life:</hi> That crosses not my saying, so long as it's true too, (as he concludes) that it goes before the new frame, and not the new frame before it; though I conceive rather, that as the soul is the Principle of Life natural both in the heart, and by the heart in the whole body; so the Spirit breathing in the Word, or the Word it self through the Spirit put into, and minded by the soul, is the Principle both of Faith, and of the new frame or spirit, begot through faith; see <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.

About the Confessions and Catechisms of particular Churches, I granted them to be the Churches boundaries, so far as they agree with the Word af God, and it may not be injurious to the Churches, or its Membens growth. To this he sayes, <hi>By growth and measure, I mean not more clear illumination, but am for Doctrinal Revelation; as if some parts of our Confession had no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and some others that being not commonly known, are not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into it, needful to be believed, as Chiliasme. Ans.</hi> Reader, I spake not of Doctrinal Revelation; for the revelation of all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be known while here, is given in the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Nec ulli ex singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis nec universae Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae licet novum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquod Dogma excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere. <hi>Calv Inst.</hi> lib. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi> ss. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> and thence to be fetched. It's not the Churches part to reveal Doctrine, but to receive and confess it. But I spake of growth in apprehension and understanding of what God hath in the Scriptures revealed; and as they grow in that, they may grow more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Confession; that that's perfect, is not yet come in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; and as that that's more perfect, comes, (a more perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding) so that that's imperfecter in expression, may fall off, and give place to what is clearer, as it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the Reformed Churches.<note place="margin">Calv Inst. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ss.</hi> 12.</note> Either let him say, the Church is perfect in knowledge; or let him say, that she may grow more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in understanding and confession. 2. His suggestions about our Confessions here and after, p. 4. where he says, that <hi>I think Confessions that are to be subscribed to, be prejudicial to Christian growth and liberty;</hi> follow not from my sayings; for my words were not applied to any particular Confessions and Catechisms, but in the general Theory; his assertion was indefinite, and my answer was so too, such as might take in the <hi>Roman, Grecian,</hi> or <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> Churches. I hope he wil not say all their Confessions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisms are fit to be subscribed, or are fit boundaries for the Churches, not agreeing in all things with the Word of God, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:179873:16"/> being injurious to the Churches growth. So that speaking of Catechismes and confessions so generally, it was needful to put in those limitations, nor I hope are they suh as our Church will judge unwarrantable, especially if we consider the Confessions and Catechisms then in being *, from those that were then taken,<note place="margin">The Synods.</note> and took themselves for the Church; which they that are now the Heads of it wil not admit (I suppose) of: Nor yet follows it, that people are upon uncertainties stil no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then they were before the Reformation;<note place="margin">

He brings two Arguments from the Churches Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism against my Doctrine, viz. 1. <hi>God the Holy Ghost sanctifieth all the elect people of God;</hi> whence he gathers, <hi>elected first, and then sanctified.</hi> But first, the Catechism sayes not so; nor doth its say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enforce it, more than that the world was before God made it; first a World, and then made; because it says, God made all the World: Or than that saying, <hi>Husbands love your Wives,</hi> implies they are first their Wives before they love them. Yet 2. I grant they were first elected in Christ before sanctified; for they are yet but sanctifying. Election is an act at once, and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Believers in the <hi>praeter tense;</hi> but sanctification is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Work: <hi>In the day that I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand,</hi> Ezek. 20.5. But sanctification is all our life long, and in respect of the whole Church, all the World long. See what the Church means by Elect, in <hi>Collect</hi> on <hi>All-Saints day, viz.</hi> Such as be knit together in one communion and fellowship in the Mystical body of Christ; which compared with the Creed, and by the title of the day, appears to be <hi>All Saints.</hi>

                  <p>He says that I say, <hi>God electeth those that are sanctified, chuseth the godly man, wresting the Psalm, and those that believe, and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and I cannot find where the uncalled are said to be elected.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> There are divers falshoods in these expressions. 1. Where said I, <hi>God chuseth the sanctified?</hi> Or 2. That he chuseth the godly, and him that believeth. In p. 79. my saying was, <hi>God hath chosen the godly man to himself;</hi> not <hi>chuseth</hi> in the present tense. And yet 3dly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65.4. says in the present tense, <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou chusest.</hi> So that it's no error to say in such a sense, God chuseth the godly man, and causes him to approach to him; That God chuseth the wicked man, the drunkard or whore-master, I never read 4. Wherein do I wrest the <hi>Psalm,</hi> seeing himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, the vulgar <hi>English</hi> reads it so as I did? and indeed, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate to God, and to chuse, are of a like sense. 5. As I said, I find not any yet uncalled, called Elect; so neither hath he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me where in the Scriptures any such are so called.</p>

His second Argument is, that children are taught to say, they be not able to serve God without his special Grace; whence he infers, <hi>That he that hath learned that Lesson, will never answer to the Name Universalist. Ans.</hi> Mind me again <hi>Reader,</hi> and see the weakness of this argument and inference: The child is immediately thereupon taught that he must at all times call upon God for that Grace by diligent prayer; which implies, that that special Grace is something that follows faith, because to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by calling upon God, which requires faith before it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:179873:20"/> chosen, who was a Law-worker.

And yet 2ly. I deny his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that then <hi>Paul</hi> had never been chosen; for <hi>Paul</hi> sought to be justified by the Faith of Christ, he tells us so him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We that are Jews by nature, knowing that a man is not justified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law.</hi> Had he been disobedient to the heavenly Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he had not been justified; and that he was ever Called, Elected, or Chosen till he became obedient to that, I find not; or that he was Elected to holiness and blamelesness before God in love otherwise then as so considered. But if because he did sometimes seek Justification by Works before he believed, therefore God doth chuse such, and not refuse them from his owning justifying Grace (for as for his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Grace he excepts or refuses none,<note place="margin">See my <hi>Caveat</hi> Chap. last.</note> though he dispenses that diversly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his good pleasure, and the counsel of his Will) then we may say he chose Drunkards, and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters also to be holy and blameless before him in love, for such he calls and brings into Christ. But I no where find the Scripture speak in that language: nay, whereas <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.2, 3. uses that as an argument to draw off men from loving vanity, That God hath chosen, or separated for himself, the godly man, this would put this answer into their mouths; <hi>Tush, he hath chosen also Law-workers, and workers of iniquity, and therefore we may still love vanity.</hi>

Or it is the Genitive case of the subject; and so we say Election and Salvation is not of God that shews mercy; that is, it is not he that is elected and saved: nor of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker as opposed to the believer; but of the believer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving willer and worker. Even as a mans living upon alms is of the Giver as the cause of it, and not of the Receiver as proceeding from him, or deserved by him; though it be of such as the subject so living; that is, they onely live so that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive alms; they that refuse them cannot live of them. The second is a false consequence, with a falshood in the end of it: 1. For though Election be of such as believe and persevere in Faith (though that's no phrase of mine; for men are elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Election be made firm, and whether they do make it sure or firm, or not, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.) yet it is not of workers in respect of their works, in the Scripture-language: for that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses Faith and Works, and Grace and Works, and the Believer and Worker: and therefore the believer is not a worker in that sense, that it denies election end salvation to works or workers in: see for this <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>To him that worketh not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him that justifies the ungodly, his Faith is imputed for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:</hi> Where the believer is not a worker, but a not-worker. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>If of grace, then not of works; and if of works, then not of grace:</hi> But Faith cannot be included in those works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause faith and grace stand together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>It is of Faith, that it might be by Grace.</hi>

For though I say his sacrifice purged the heavenly things by his entring in thither; yet I deny not that the purgation was made by that that was done on earth, as what was there done was presented to his Father in heaven in the virtues of it: even as the blood of the sacrifice that made the atonement in and for the holy of holies was the same that was shed without the holy of holies, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.7. but it did not make the atonement simply, as it was shed without, but as it was presented within the vail.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:179873:24"/> yet in a sence the places and ways of entring are both opposed to each other, and in both those things the Apostle shews that Christs sacrifice far exceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Can that be a reason or evidence of a thing that hath no relation to that thing?

That our <hi>Redemption then was by the blood of Christ is true; out not without its virtues being presented in the heavens themselves.</hi> Nor doth that place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13 11, 12. invincibly prove, <hi>That the crucifying of Christ tipified by the burning of the beast without the Camp, did perfect and complete the Sacrifice</hi> (or rather <hi>the Oblation) of him;</hi> unless it can be proved that that burning of the beast was the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblation and offering of it; which sure it was not: for it was neither by the Priest, nor upon the Altar, which was in the court of the Tabernacle, and not without the camp: so that that's nothing to the offering that was made before by the Priests in <hi>ver.</hi> 24. It proves we have an Altar they might not

Affirmatively, in which I was for the largest, in explicating this affirmative position, that he is, <hi>Custos utriusque tabulae, Keeper of both Tables,</hi> which I did with reference to either Table; and though the commandments being mostly negatively, my explications had diverse negative expressions in them, yet all tended to clear the extent of the Affirmative position; <hi>That Gods word allows many things that are not commanded or appointed in his word,</hi> was said also in effect by me.

For 2. The power of Magistrates is beyond their duty; they may do more then they are bound to do. God allows some things that he commands not; as the Apostles and Ministers to marry, and forbear working: What hee commands the Magistrate expresly or implicitely is his duty, but his power goes further; he may do also what he may lawfully let alone: and it was his power he (not I) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, not his Duty. I said not therefore it is his duty to take away all such things, but he hath power to do it; they being not expresly or impliedly God's orders, he may (if he please) see God's worship kept clear of them; for he sins not if he keep out nothing from it that God would have in it, or about it. This Answer was not Negative, what he might not do, as he said above almost all was; but affirmative, what he may do, and he that denies him this, crumps his power, not I.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Hac. 2. <hi>The day of judgement is secret, and hid from the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and comes like a snare: But by this all men shall know when it shall be, namely, at the term of a th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nay, this opinion says it's secret too, because it begins at Christ's descent from heaven, of which no man knows; nor is it said, just at the end of the 1000 years shall the other dead be raised, but not til they be ended; at the end of which is <hi>Gogs</hi> and <hi>Magogs</hi> gathering together, before the other be. Let him read Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> about the Day of Judgement, <hi>De mille annis tubae septimae, &amp; placita Hebraeorum de magno Die Judicij,</hi> and inform himself better of this opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hac. 3. <hi>It makes two Resurrections of the body, one a great distance of time after the other, and they believe but one resurrection of the just and unjust.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a mistake too; for God himself shall be with them, even their God, while his tabernacle is with men and the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> not in, but come down from Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2, 3, 4 and they shall have no night, no interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, chap. 22.5, 6. <hi>Gog and Magog conspiring, shall not hinder them, but they shall be blessed and holy continually,</hi> Rev. 20.6.

To that he sayes, it's said elsewhere, quoting <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.28. but names not the words, because they are not so as he says, but the hour comes when all that are in their Graves shall hear his voice, and come forth: We shewed how the Scripture takes the word <hi>Hour,</hi> in answer to his third argument: Yea, there also the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to life is first named. He quotes also <hi>Mark</hi> 25.31 but mis-reads it; for it's not, <hi>When the Son of Man cometh, he shall separate one from another,</hi> (though something of that too, shall be when he cometh) but <hi>when the Son of Man cometh,</hi> (or is come, <gap reason="foreign">

But if Death was totally destroyed at his coming, when then is the Kingdom in, which he shall reign after his coming, and his Saints with him, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. so then there is a raising those that are his, at his coming; and at the end, or a little before, the destroying of Death from off all others too: Which things I urged before, but he passed them without answer, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells me, <hi>I lose my self in confusions,</hi> out of which he endeavours to bring me by telling me of a <hi>twofold Kingdom; one natural, absolute and essential, as God, of which is no end; and the other Ministerial and Oe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Very right; but this he shall not deliver up at his coming, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when he hath destroyed Death, for this is the Kingdom he is gone to receive, and to return, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.12.

               <p>And 3dly, It's opposed to, and distinguished from the rising again of the rest of the dead, who were raised onely in body afterwards: But <hi>the rest of the dead lived not again,</hi> he sayes, <hi>means, Satan detained many still in Paganism and Antichristianism, who would not rise out of sin and death.</hi>

Reader, judge; doth the saying they lived not again till the thousand years were finished, imply that they lived not at all? Truly then it might have been said rather, they lived not again when the thousand years were ended: Nay, doth he not afterwards in ver. 12. mention the general resurrection of them also? <hi>This is the first resurrection,</hi> (he sayes) <hi>is all one, as this is the resurrection from the death of sin:</hi> From which they were raised before their being beheaded for the testimony of Christ, and this is after it. <hi>That it's not the same kind of life that is affirmed of those in the fourth verse, and denyed of those in the fifth; and that those in the fifth,</hi> revixerint, (he should have said, <hi>non revixerint) lived not again the life of Grace:</hi> are barely his sayings, without proof or reason: Their not living again, argues a fore-living: But I pray, did they ever before live the life of Grace, and were lost from it, that shall never live it?

BEcause I noted what their principles speak of God, that seeing he can have no new immanent act of Will, and he hath not willed (say they to save the most, it follows that God cannot save the most of men. He charges me with <hi>seeming to speak ignorantly and irreverently of God's attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes:</hi> Whereas I appeal to thee <hi>Reader,</hi> whether my collection from their principles be not fair; and whether there be any irreverence at least attributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto me in that my collection: Nay, is it fairly done of him, to make thee believe that I infer that from the former onely, which I infer not but from both those their sayings. His other charges then, <hi>that I am afraid lest God's Decrees should deprive him of his liberty, as if his hands were tyed</hi> (which yet follows from their sayings compared) <hi>and that my Divinity finds more solace in</hi> Seneca's Hercules furens, <hi>than in Gods word,</hi> because I noted, that those their principles agree with those Stoical passages, (which are none of those ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable opinions that he after pleads for, but of the worst of them are abuses; as also his taxing me with asserting it an error, that God can have no new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent act of will, when as I onely noted it as their saying: Yea they are meer slanders of me, to say, that <hi>I impeach three of God's most sacred attributes, as</hi> 1. <hi>His Immutability.</hi> 2. <hi>His Providence. And</hi> 3dly, <hi>his Omnipotency.</hi> For first, I did not charge it as an error to say, God cannot will a-new, but onely noted how from that and their other saying, it follows that God cannot save the most, it's a secret above my power to determine: And yet how that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies God's Immutability, I see no more, then to say he can work <hi>de novo:</hi> He may will <hi>de novo,</hi> that wills new things, though not contrary to what he hath willed, but onely different. New motions of the mind imply no more muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the mind, than new motions of the hand imply mutability in the hand, much less if neither the one nor the other be properly motions; and therefore that God is one mind, and who can turn him? as <hi>Job</hi> sayes, <hi>and works all things according to the counsel of his will,</hi> as <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith, or <hi>ordains, disposes, and over-rules the actions of wicked men to his glory,</hi> is little to his purpose, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that, or to make good his second charge, <hi>viz.</hi> that I impeach his Providence, which I compared not with the Stoicks fate, as he falsly says: It was their Opinions I compared with the Stoicks fate, that render it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for God to save some men that are yet under his patience; for not onely his hands are tyed that cannot do what he wills, as he says, but his too, that cannot wi l what and when he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I have shewed the groundlesness of his charge, in my first Chapter, that their own principles are more guilty of it, then my Answers evidenced, which instead of refuting, he hath abused and falsified. As for his commendations of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let him if he please, be called the <hi>Stoick-Divine,</hi> I shall not grudge it him, nor follow him in that vagary. <hi>That no man is brought to Heaven by universal Grace, or that sufficient help afforded to all men,</hi> is his proofless assertion, except from a <hi>Dutch</hi>-man. Some Infants at least that have no more then all men have, may go to Heaven for ought he can say to the contrary. <hi>That I plead for no other Grace than given in the first Covenant, or that I think there is no other Grace to be had, then that by which</hi> Adam <hi>stood, and notwithstanding which he fell,</hi> are meer mistakes, and senceless falshoods. I plead for the gift of Christ, and of his fulness, was he given in the first Covenant? Or did <hi>Adam</hi> stand by him? Away with such fictions.</p>

But neither did <hi>Moses</hi> accuse God to them there, nor signifie that they must perish because God had not done that for them, nor argue that they should perish at all, but was making a Covenant between them and God, that they might live, and signifies to them that they had not yet had an understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into what they had seen; sure to provoke them to humble themselves before God, and seek it of him, that he might give it them, and not think themselves to have attained it, before they had, as Christ said to <hi>Peter, What I do, thou knowest not now,</hi> John 13.7. yet that hindered not, but in following on to know, he should know it afterward.</p>

Our Saviour did not say of any of these, in any of these places, that they must perish absolutely, but spake those things to them, that they might be saved, (<hi>Ioh</hi> 5.34.) that they might be humbled to hear and learn of God by him; much less said he that they must perish because God was wanting to give that to them, by which they might be saved.</p>

               <p n="3">3dly, <hi>That I ineffect say, that this man is saved, and not another, is not of God that sheweth mercy, for he shews mercy to all; but of man that willeth and accepteth his mercy.</hi>

The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of my Doctrine that he is pleased to honor with the name of Detestable, even as of old they honored Christ's, and his Apostles sayings, is, That God through Christ holds not men under sin, because <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, and thereby are become sinners, and defiled; but for their not repenting and turning to him as his grace prevents them, as in <hi>Ich.</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is the condemnation</hi> (not that the world is naturally in darkness, but) <hi>that light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather then light.</hi> To all his abuses and wrestings of my words before discovered, he is pleased to give a dumb Answer; not so much as once acknowledging any fault, though he cannot defend them: no, yee may be sure that he that takes it ill, that I let the world know that he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a Letter to me of some harsh sayings, will not do publike penance, though of falshood he is never so clearly and before the world convicted; but if that be the the way for him to prosper, I am deceived.</p>

Was Christ's dying for a man the Redemtion actually applied, so as he is justified, regenerated <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> and are all that Christ dyed for so?

Answ.</hi> Was it their love that Christ dyed for them? or if their love had any constraining force upon them; was it not from his love causing it? Is it not more likely that Christs love that was stronger then their's should have the glory of constraning them? and how could the people but imagine [what he says <hi>he would not have them imagine that what he spake of his ministery tended to his own commendation</hi>] if it was not the love of Christ to them, but theirs to him that he commended? In his. 3. <hi>He talkes of all being chosen alike without difference:</hi> which is neither my assertion, nor to the place he had in hand. 4. He asks, <hi>would the Apostles, making all their hearers beleive that Christ loved them all, and dyed for them all without difference, worke upon the disobedient, &amp;c. Ans.</hi> Let him aske the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles what wrought upon them that were disobedient. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4. Was it not the love of God to mankinde? he says not some peculiar love to themselves: and what should the Apostles preach to others to turn them, but what turned themselves? did Christ preach any other love to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to regenerate him, but <hi>God so loved the world &amp;c.

Nor cry we out, <hi>that special and eternall love causes men to cast off all care of salvation:</hi> but we say, that mens preaching of election as they do, and a speciall love they know not to whom, and hiding and denying the Generall love of God which should draw them in to Christ, who is the object and ground of that special love, doth them no good, nor lead them to profit, but to hurt, while it leads them to seeke the foundation of their faith and hope in themselves, and not in Christ. When I said that the Pharisee thought he could not have been so good as he was, if God had not had special and Eternall love toward him, I denyed not arguments from special love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but implied that men often think that their zeal [even to persecution] is the product of what it is not.</p>

He craves my attention to some instructions he give me about <hi>Christ's worke in behalf of mankind, being diversly expressed—and that when it's compared to the payments of a debt or ransome—we must not imagine that it can have any respect to such satisfying Gods justice, as that there should be any ground for not punishing the same fault again; but that when it's absolute as to some effect, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall as to some other; then its neither against reason, nor justice, nor custom; but that the payment, pardon, or satisfaction may be twofold. Ans.</hi> Well, but then so far as a payment is absolute, he grants it's not again demandable; though so far as conditionall it may be, if the condition be not performed: and so I clearly implyed to any that could understand. Oh! but it's <hi>onely absolute he says to make sins pardonable, and justice and wrath appeasable</hi> (and what then must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease it actual y, some work or act of man?) <hi>but not actually beneficiall to any to life eternal, but upon repentance and belief. Ans.</hi> It's the men that opposed my Doctrine, &amp; whose Doctrine I opposed, that make it absolute for all he died for; whence that usual inference, <hi>if he dyed for all, then All must of necessity be saved:</hi> which my distinction [of sins he found upon us as he undertook for us, &amp; sins against the grace there-through extended to us] shewed to be inconsequent; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Dr Owen says, All is satisfied for,</hi> &amp; <hi>must be discharged that Christ dyed for.</hi> 2.

All their sin is pardonable and veniall; but because they never repented of their sin, and sinfulnesse, they cannot be saved If he says he speaks onely of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons grown, such as have calls to repentance, &amp; yet repent not, I sayd the same too, that they are not actually pardoned and Justified without faith &amp; repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: <hi>That my discourse was frivolous in divers of my Sections]</hi> is an easie frivolous Answer of them: with such an <hi>Answer</hi> I might have answered all his booke at once. <hi>That I said nothing to the purpose to his simile of a General pardon granted from a King, but impertinently betake my self to the point of free will in the</hi> 4th.

For whereas I proposed to him that of the Church of <hi>England, That the son of God did offer a full perfect and sufficient satisfaction and oblation for the sins of the whole world;</hi> which is as much as I desire or assert. He askes where the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land says, <hi>That all the sins proceeding from the first Adam, are of due debt forgiven to the impenitent, without further and particular application of Christ's Death.</hi> which I never yet said. Vnderstand I pray; The Church of England says, <hi>Christ offered up a full perfect and sufficent satisfaction;</hi> and I know it believes &amp; says, <hi>That what Christ offered, God acceptted.</hi> Now is that a full and perfect sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that doth not satisfy without some other thing added? If Christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (and God accepted it as) a full and perfect satisfaction for the sins of the whole world, then God is fully &amp; perfectly satisfied for them: &amp; if so, then he cannot hold them under penalty yet for them to satisfy him, but remit the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:179873:37"/> thereto. Will any man say, a Creditor is fully satisfyed for a debt, for which he holds the debter yet in bands, so as that he will not discharge him, unlesse something more be done to him? or is the Death of Christ applyed particulary to or by us for satisfaction to God (or rather for cure &amp; healing to us) that he should not forgive what he is satisfyed fully for, without that as he implies? and yet it follows not that the inpenitent are pardoned, or have the pardon of all those sins: for though the pardon of them is given into the hand of Christ that satisfied for them: and he gives, tenders, or freely extends it to men; yet if they to whom it's given will not accept it, but refuse it, and still be in their emmity; they deprive themselves of the benefit of what was given them freely, and cannot claime the benefit of it. Thus they that observe lying vanities, are said to forsake their own mercies. <hi>Ion.</hi> 2.8. They were truly theirs in respect of the gift of God, and yet not accepting them, they go without them, and without actuall repenting thereof lose them for ever. It may be said of them as God sayd of <hi>Israell</hi> in respect of purging them, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> I <hi>purged thee and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged any more &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 24.13. So because God pardon'd them, and they were not pardon'd, refused his pardon; therefore they shall not be pardoned any more. A King that forgives his subjects all former rebellions, and seals or proclaimes their pardon to them, truly pardons them on his part; yet if they tread that under foot, and scorn it, they are not pardoned: but that their rejecting of it (which was not any thing included in the generall pardon, because consequentiall to it) brings all their sins again upon them, till they submit and sue out their pardon again: and so as he said above, the pardon may be twofold. To this purpose is that <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38 39.40. <hi>Pardon is preached or declared to men in Christ's Name,</hi> and yet <hi>ver.</hi> 40 take heed least that come upon you, <hi>Behold ye dispisers, and wonder, and perish!</hi> and so much also is held forth in. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22.23, 24. and 5.18.</p>

               <p>Nor is it true <hi>that the latter part of my Answer about Election is concerning the Gospel, and not at all concerning Election.</hi> For <hi>I</hi> said not God chose such a Doctrine or proposion, but that God chose in Christ all the seed of the travaile of his soule to holinesse and blessing with him, which speakes of Election (for is not choise Election? and of men chosen, for such is the seed that Christ shall see, and to such it ordaines life and all meanes to life: but its likely he looks after an Election that the Gospel says nothing of, but such a one I had nothing to do with: the truth is, <hi>any Argument though never so slender, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer though never so slightly, and any evasion albeit most frivolous, serves the turne well enough with him, so he can set it on with great accusations or swelling language.</hi>

I said the workes of God preach mercy to sinners as well as that God is just to punnish sin; and the contents of the Gospel, as well as this of the Law.

He charges me with teaching two great errors. 1. <hi>That all worship done to any god, is done to the true God</hi> 2. <hi>That all kindness that God-sheweth to sinners, is the manifestation of his Gospel. Answ.</hi> Sure the man thinks his tongue is his own, he may speak what he pleases: what I said, or implyed, was this: 1. That the works of God bear witness to the true God, and to his goodness. 2. That the Heathens apprehend a god from what they preached, and that he is good, though they missed of the knowledge of who is this God. 3. Thar the mercy the works of God preach in God, is what is towards man through Christ, and pertains to the Gospel, as included in its contents: but I nowhere call, or think it the manifestation of the Gospel. He confesses the Ravens cry to God,<note place="margin">Novum testimonium advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, omni litteraturà notius, sed te simplicem, &amp; rudem, &amp; impolitum advoco, qualem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent qui te solum habent: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritiâ tuâ mihi opus est, quia aliquantulae peritiae tuae nemo credit; Deus bonus est, Deus benefacitt; ua vox est, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull. de testim. anim. proinde in excusabilis est omnis etiam infidelis si non diligit Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Deum suum toto corde, totâ animâ, totâ virtute, cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat nempe intus ei innata: &amp; non ignota ratione justitia, quia ex toto se illum diligere debeat, cui se totum debere non ignorat. <hi>Bern. ibid.</hi>

He askes, where I find Gods kindness to sinners called Gospel? and I ask, where he finds his judgements upon them called law? yet I find his kindness in the contents of the Gospel, and that was it I said. It's no fruit of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, nor content of the law of works, and therefore of the Gospel surely; and I think none but Mr. <hi>Hac.</hi> nor he neither, if not upon a design, would question it. Yea, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. <hi>verbatim,</hi> tells us, <hi>The Gospel is preached in every creature,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that agrees with <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.9, 10. <hi>That the tender mercies of God are upon all his works,</hi> namely his mercies to men, (yea, upon the Devils, though not in, or from them; in that he restrains their malice, and wickedness against us) and all his works do praise him. But to quarrel with me, and call for some distinct knowledge of Christ from the creatures, when I expresly said they do not speak of him distinctly: what is it but to be groundlesly contentious? See how a man blinded with prejudice and passion lofes his reason; for he says, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.16. <hi>He suffered all Nations to walk in their own ways:</hi> nevertheless he did them good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> overthrows the false doctrine throughout this <hi>Chapter,</hi> (that is to say, his own, to speak trule and properly; but see his reason. <hi>He suffered them to perish, notwithstanding his ordinary goodness; therefore his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral blessings were not able to reelaim them, nor were intended for their conversion.</hi> How many faults in this reason? 1. That it puts that into the conclusion that denies nothing asserted, and therefore needs not be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that Gods temporal blessings were not able (that is, by themselves) to reclaim them. 2. But for the other part, against the intent of them: Reader, thou mayst be at thy choise, whither to believe the Apostle, that says, <hi>The goodness of God leads thee, O man, to Repentance:</hi> — or Mr. <hi>Hac.</hi> that says, it was not intended for thy conversion, that is, for thy repentance. 3. By parity of reason, he suffered many of the <hi>Jews</hi> to perish, notwithstanding the Prophets, and Christ that were amongst them; therefore they were not able to reclain them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.11, 12, 13.</note> nor were intended for their conversion.<note place="margin">

What's become of the import of the word <hi>nevertheless,</hi> that he speak of in <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. doth not that shew an exemption here, as much as there? surely the one as much as the other: It signifies clearly, that though he let them take their own courses (as he did the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.11.) yet he was not wanting to them by his goodness, to invite them to seek him, and walk in his ways.</p>

About <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he mistakes my <hi>Qu.</hi> and <hi>Ans.</hi> as if the import of them was, that faith is wrought by means of Gods works only; which though I think may be, and hope is through the help of Gods Spirit, from what arguments are brought in <hi>Job,</hi> altogether from the works of God, both as evidences that they had faith, and as motives to induce to it: as <hi>Job</hi> 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. And from the Apostles saying, <hi>If the Gentiles by nature</hi> [that is, without verbal, or wrirten instruction from the published Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine] <hi>do the things contained in the law,</hi> [of which I am sure faith in God is one] yet my question was not about that, but about Gods accepting faith in those that have not the distinct knowledge of Christ, and to that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances were pertinent. He says, <hi>There were many Proselytes not circumcised, who had the knowledge of the true God, and walked in obedience to him.</hi> But consider it again, they could not be the persons there spoken of, because they did not by nature, and without the law, the things contained in the law; but what of the law they did, they did by the law. Now from that and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.21, 22. I gather the variety of means: for the nature by which some are supposed to do the things in the law, is distinct from the law, and the Prophets; and they again distinct from the Gospel, as preached by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: Is not there then variety?</p>

In his quarrel about false conceptions of God, he tells me: 1. <hi>It was not for making</hi> cruelty <hi>a false conception of him, but for opposing it to all mercy. Answ.</hi> Such an opposition I must make to it, as is also a false conception; else, I had put a true conception for a false one: and is not cruelty such a one? let any one judge. I think all-justice, which he now suggests (before it was just severity) had been much more liable to exception: for I think he is all-just, and all-justice; nothing unjust, or of injustice in him; righteous in all his works. 2. Yet I did not oppose cruelty to all-mercy, but all-mercy to cruelty; for I had write cruelty first, and then thought what to oppose to it, and not <hi>è contra.</hi> I told him, I charged it on no party determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, but spake of it in the general Theory only. He replies, that <hi>I say its a word that borders upon their principles, and that he was guilty of the charge, because he past it not untoucht, and so that I know his thoughts better then my own. Answ.</hi> What I said in my Answer, was after, and distinct from what I said and thought in composing my Catechisme, and therefore my thoughts then do not prove that I had the same so many years before: and I might well now suspect him guilty, because grieved at it.

But he says, <hi>he alledged</hi> Bellarmines <hi>words, speaking of picturing only, but not of any likeness. Answ.</hi> Then he alledged them to no purpose, and prevaricated by his own confession: for he alledged them to prove that <hi>the Papists own the thinking God like an Old Man.</hi> And how doth <hi>Bellarmines</hi> saying prove it, if it said nothing of any likeness?

About falling from grace: He excepts against my saying, that a fained and unsound saith makes men hypocrites; and says, <hi>Such a faith is a better then none, because an historical faith may be a true faith in its kind, hath a true being, and is of good use and benefit. Answ.</hi> But is an historical faith, and a fained and unsound faith all one? His expression I spake to, was an unfound and fained faith, not an historical faith: an historical faith, if it be the faith of a ttue history, as the histury of the Scripture is, is a sound faith and not fained, if it be indeed a belief of it: but a faining to believe the history, when one doth not, is neither a true faith in its being, as to the act of it, nor of any good use or benefit to him that hath it, but is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie. And though <hi>he say an hyopcrite is not so bad as a vitious, and openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ungodly person;</hi> yet others say, that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfit holiness is double wickedness.<note place="margin">Simulata sanctitas duplex est iniquitas.

Grace signifies the doctrine of grace. <hi>Answ.</hi> So I said too, and how then doth he confute me? but I trow, that revolting from the Covenant of grace implies that they embraced it: if but fainedly, then they ran not well, nor were the Sons of God. He addes, 1. <hi>That the defection of a Church from sound Doctrine to errour, is no good argument to prove the revolt of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular believer from the habit of saving faith: nor of any one individual person from sound doctrine: for an erroneous generation might rise up. Answ.</hi> But the revolting of persons that ran well, nnd were Sons of God, and had the Spirit of God, and were known of God, so as that Christ shall profit them nothing, doth.

Presume not on thy life; for what is thy life but a bubble? and who can tell how short it may be? or if thou shouldest live long, how hard thy heart may be, dreaming of yet a little longer, and a little longer time, till destruction suddenly fall upon thee? while it is a day of grace, thou mayest enter the strait gate, though never so
